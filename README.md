# Groovy Null vs. Empty String Handling

This example showcases a common pitfall in Groovy when dealing with null and empty strings.  The `myMethod` function attempts to gracefully handle both scenarios. However, relying on direct comparison (`==`) with null and empty string can lead to unexpected behavior depending on context and other Groovy features such as implicit type coercion.

The `bug.groovy` file demonstrates the original problem.  The `bugSolution.groovy` file provides a more robust solution.

## Solution

The improved code in `bugSolution.groovy` uses the `isNullOrEmpty()` method for better handling of both null and empty cases. This approach is clearer and avoids potential issues arising from direct null comparison.
